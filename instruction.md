@workspace Create a Python project for real-time object detection from camera streams with the following requirements:

## Project Goal
Build a real-time object detection system that processes camera streams

## Environment Setup
- Target platform: Windows 11 with Nvidia GPU
- Python environment: Use existing Python installation with uv package manager
- Virtual environment: Utilize the existing uv-managed virtual environment

## Dependencies
- Install YOLOv11 for object detection

## Core Features
- **Multi-camera support**: Implement RTSP protocol to receive multiple camera streams
- **Real-time display**: Create separate display windows for each camera stream showing detected objects with colored bounding boxes
- **GPU acceleration**: Configure object detection to use Nvidia GPU for performance
- **Offline model**: Use a pre-trained object detection model that works without internet connection
